Actually said by me, right now, at Subway: “You went with the flatbread? Damn, son.  That’s beast mode.”

Far Cry 3 is literally a game where you get missions to cook dogs with flamethrowers, NO, IT CANNOT REPRESENT AWFUL THINGS IN A SMART WAY

@MrPodunkian i love me too

...you know what, I'm not even going to half-ass this: Far Cry 3 is full of shit and I hope its devs are forced to apologize for it.
ExpBelieve
So basically when a game like Far Cry 3 features goofy bugs, weird animations and a clearly escapist sandbox tone...

@marcopennekamp hrm..  well that would be a problem.  You don't have a key with '~' or ` on it?

@zacaj_ If it was not for my german keyboard, then yes. But I can't find the button you call "tilde". My version of it does not work. ;)

Did MK make people more violent? Probably not. Did it desensitize them to other depictions of gore? Prrrrrrrrrrrrobably.
ExpBelieve
SPR's depiction of gore was necessary to make its impact and show the reality of war. But that's clearly not true for, say, Mortal Kombat.
